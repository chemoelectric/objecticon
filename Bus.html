<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a program which displays a map of the London bus network. In order to run, it requires some additional files, which are contained in the file <code>busroutes.tar.gz</code>, which can be downloaded from the sourceforge <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/chemoelectric-objecticon/files/misc/"><code>misc</code> directory</a>. Extract this file in your home directory. It will create a directory <code>busroutes</code>. You can extract it somewhere else if you wish, but then you will need to pass the directory to the <code>bus</code> program with the <code>-d</code> option.</p>
<p>At startup, a view of the entire bus network is shown.</p>

<h1 id="controls">Controls</h1>
<p>To zoom in and out, use mouse wheel up and down respectively. To move the map, drag the mouse. To locate a specific bus stop quickly, type its name in the text field at the top and press return.</p>
<p>Each bus route has a particular colour. Lines between stops are multi-coloured if several routes traverse between them. Arrows are shown if a line between stops is in one direction only.</p>
<p>Here is a view of the routes around Richmond, at full zoom. Note the how the line between “The Quadrant” and “Richmond Station” is multi-coloured; there are 11 routes between those two stops.</p>

<p>Moving the mouse over a stop or a line between stops will show the routes that run there.</p>
<h1 id="menus">Menus</h1>
<p>Right-clicking on a stop or a line lets a filter be set, so that only particular routes are displayed. Filters can be saved in a file and loaded by right clicking on a blank part of the screen. This menu also lets the filter be cleared.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a filter which show all the routes from Richmond Station.</p>

<p>To see the shortest route between two stops, select “Mark” on the first stop, and “Join” on the second. The shortest route is then indicated by the stops with a red dot in the centre.</p>
<h1 id="command-line-options">Command line options</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>-n</strong> Show the night-time bus network.</li>
<li><strong>-r</strong> Show just the given route; may be specified several times to give several routes.</li>
<li><strong>-d</strong> Specify the directory containing the data files; by default <code>busroutes</code> in the same directory as the <code>bus</code> program, or failing that in the home directory.</li>
