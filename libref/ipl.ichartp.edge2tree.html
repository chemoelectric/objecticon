edge2tree:  edge -&gt; tree
e -&gt; t
<p/>
where e is an edge structure (active or inactive; both are okay)
where t is a tree like what's described in Ralph Griswold's
structs library (IPL); I don't know about the 2nd ed. of
Griswold &amp; Griswold, but the structure is described in the 1st
ed. in section 16.1
<p/>
fails if, for some reason, the conversion can't be made (e.g. the
edge structure has been screwed around with in some way)
