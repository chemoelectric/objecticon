# This class groups several Buttons together.  Then, when the
# mouse is clicked down on one of the Buttons and then dragged
# onto another before being released, the other Button will go
# "down".  This is the common behaviour for buttons in a bar
# along the top of an application.
# 
# NB - A Button must be added to the {ButtonGroup} and the
# {Dialog} too.
# @example
# @ bg := ButtonGroup()
# @ b := TextButton()
# @ b.set_label("Okay")
# @ self.add(b)
# @ bg.add(b)
#
class ButtonGroup()
   public 
   buttons

   #
   # Add the given {Button} to the {ButtonGroup}.
   # @param c   The {Button} to add
   #
   public add(c)
      put(self.buttons, c)
      c.set_parent_button_group(self)
   end
