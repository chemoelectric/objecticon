#summary Describes the io package

= Introduction =

This page gives an overview of the `io` package, which provides Object Icon's object-oriented replacement to Icon's builtin `File` type.

= Details =

The central class in the `io` package is `Stream`.  This class models a file-like object which can have some or all of the following operations :-
 * input
 * output
 * seek and tell
 * truncation

The `io` package also provides some procedures which emulate the old Icon buitlin functions which the package replaces (`write`, `open`, etc).
