jcont does this wrong :-
procedure main(args)
   local s,i
   s := "abcde"
   i := -8
   write("F ", i, ". ", s[3+:i] | "--")
   write("F ", i, ". ", s[3+:-8] | "--")
   write("F ", i, ". ", s[3:-5] | "--")
end

procedure main(a)
   local x
   x := [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
   every write(image(!(x[-3+:6])))
end

insert(), member() etc different from icon/jcon

bigint for to by works in oi not icon

jcon counts list serial nos in a different way
procedure main()
   local t
   t := table()
   insert(t, 1, 2)
   insert(t, 3, 5)
   write(image(sort(t)))
   write(image(list()))
end


seek behaves differently
procedure main(a)
   local f,i
   #f := open("/dev/null","r")
   f := open("tmp1","w")
   write(f, "shorter\nfile")
   close(f)
   f := open("tmp1","r")
   if seek(f,1000) then
      write("YES:",where(f))
   else
      write("NO")
   writes("   nonseq:\t ")
   every i := 30 to -30 by -1 do
      if seek(f, i) then
	 writes(map(reads(f), "\n", ".") | "?")
      else
	 writes("-")
   write()
   close(f)

end
