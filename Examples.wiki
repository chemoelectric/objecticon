= Examples =
The `examples/` directory contains some example programs.  Here are some notes about the more interesting ones.

 * *colors* Interactively choose a colour in RGB/HLS format
 * *cursors* Show all available mouse cursors
 * *dndtest* Demonstrate tree/list drag and drop, and in-place editing
 * *editor* A simple text editor
 * *explorer* A simple file-system explorer
 * *fonttest* Explore available fonts
 * *geturl* A very useful command-line program for retrieving files over http (rather like wget).  Run `geturl -help` for options.
 * *lslinks* List the HTML links in a web page.
 * *memorytracker* Run an object icon program and show its memory usage (try `memorytracker ivib`)
 * *stock* A stock-ticker program.  Enter a ticker symbol in the text field and press return, or a company name and select from the drop-down suggestions. Right-click on the ticker symbol to delete it.
 * *suggest* A tongue-in-cheek demo of the `SuggestField` class, which is a `TextField` with a popup list offering suggestions.
 * *browser* A simple web browser, built upon the classes in the `ipl.browser` package, which can render HTML documents.
 * *ttexplorer* Like `explorer` above, but uses a `TreeTable`
