# This class is one "pane" in an {OverlaySet}, which is rather
# like a {TabSet} except that there are no tabs, and control
# over which pane is displayed is entirely the affair of the
# program.
#
# The components inside have their size and position computed
# relative to the parent OverlaySet and also inherit the
# OverlaySet's windowing attributes.
# Components are added using the {add} method of {Component}.
