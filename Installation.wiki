#summary Installation of Object Icon

Object Icon uses autoconf for its configuration.  

 * [Installation#Installing_from_the_subversion_source_repository Installing from the subversion source repository]
 * [Installation#Installing_from_a_tar_gz_file Installing from a .tar.gz file]
 * [Installation#Compilation Compilation]

== Installing from the subversion source repository ==
To do this you need autoconf installed (at least version 2.61).

Use the following command to checkout a read-only copy of the source code :-

{{{svn co http://objecticon.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ objecticon}}}

This will create a directory {{{objecticon}}} under the present
directory (you can change the last parameter to create a different
directory name if you want).

Then cd into that directory and run the command @code{autoconf}.  This will
create a @code{configure} script.

Then proceed just the same as if you had downloaded the .tar.gz file.
== Installing from a tar gz file ==

Extract the source code from the .tar.gz file with a command like
@code{tar xfz objecticon-1.0.tar.gz}.  This will create a directory
@code{objecticon-1.0} under the current directory.  Obviously the
version number may be different.

Change to the new directory and run @code{./configure}.  This
command accepts various options - run @code{./configure --help} to
see them.  The @code{./configure} script prints a summary of
the options when it finishes, for example.

@example
Summary:-
X11 graphics           : yes
jpeg library           : yes
Xft anti-aliased fonts : yes
Xpm                    : yes
zlib compression       : yes
dynamic loading        : yes
crypt lib              : yes
makeinfo >=4.8         : yes
mysql lib              : yes
context switch         : config/system/linux_x86/rswitch.s
@end example

The meaning of these various options is as follows.

 * X11 graphics
Determines whether the Icon graphics facilities are built.  The
following three options only apply if this is 'yes'.
 * jpeg library
Allows loading of jpeg images.
 * Xft anti-aliased fonts
Fonts are drawn with smooth edges using the xft and freetype libraries.
This looks nice, but is considerably slower than using traditional X
bitmap fonts.
 * Xpm Allows loading of xpm images.
 * zlib compression - Allows zlib compressed files (ie .gz files), to be read/written via the "z" flag in the open function.  Also allows icode files to be compressed with the -Z flag given to the @code{oit}.
 * dynamic loading
Allows shared library (.so) files containing native functions to be
loaded at runtime.
 * crypt lib
This just enables the builtin crypt() function.
 * mysql lib -Allows a dynamic library to be built which provides an interface to
mysql.  Has no effect either way on the runtime system proper.
 * context switch -This is a system-dependent source file which is used by co-expressions.  If the value is @code{config/system/default/rswitch.c}, then co-expressions will not be
functional (activation will end with a runtime error).
