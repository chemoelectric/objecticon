Customizable sort procedure for inclusion in Icon programs.
<pre>
     isort(x,keyproc,y)
</pre>
Argument x can be any Icon data type that is divisible into elements
by the unary element generation (!) operator.  The result is a list
of the objects in sorted order.
<p/>
The default is to sort elements in their natural, Icon-defined order.
However, an optional parameter (keyproc) allows a sort key to be
derived from each element, rather than the default of using the
element itself as the key.  Keyproc can be a procedure provided by
the caller, in which case the first argument to the key procedure is
the item for which the key is to be computed, and the second argument
is isort's argument y, passed unchanged.  The keyproc must produce
the extracted key.  Alternatively, the keyproc argument can be an
integer, in which case it specifies a subscript to be applied to each
item to produce a key.  Keyproc will be called once for each element
of structure x.
