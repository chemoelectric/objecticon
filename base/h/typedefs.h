    * Icode consists of operators and arguments.  Operators are small integers,
    *  while arguments may be pointers.  To conserve space in icode files on
    *  computers with 16-bit ints, icode is written by the linker as a mixture
    *  of ints and words (longs).  When an icode file is read in and processed
    *  by the interpreter, it looks like a C array of mixed ints and words.
    *  Accessing this "nonstandard" structure is handled by a union of int and
    *  word pointers and incrementing is done by incrementing the appropriate
    *  member of the union (see the interpreter).  This is a rather dubious
    *  method and certainly not portable.  A better way might be to address
    *  icode with a char *, but the incrementing code might be inefficient
    *  (at a place that experiences a lot of execution activity).
    *
    * For the moment, the dubious coding is isolated under control of the
    *  size of integers.
