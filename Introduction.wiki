Object Icon is based on the Icon programming language, more details about which can be found at http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/.  It also borrows several ideas from another object-oriented Icon derivative, Unicon - see http://unicon.sourceforge.net/, and from Shamim Mohamed's Posix extensions - see http://www.drones.com/unicon/.
